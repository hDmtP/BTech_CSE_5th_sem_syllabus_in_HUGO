## This is my first site made with Hugo

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b1a8b28b-1c52-4b84-bb1a-7452c17bedfd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/btech-cse-5th-sem-syllabus/deploys)

<br>

#### [config.toml](https://github.com/hDmtP/BTech_CSE_5th_sem_syllabus_in_HUGO/blob/main/config.toml)
```
baseURL = 'https://btech-cse-5th-sem-syllabus.netlify.app'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'BTech CSE 5th sem syllabus'
theme = "hugo-theme-shell"
schema = "monokai"
```

<br>

***Deployed in Netlify through Drag-Drop. [Site is online here!](https://btech-cse-5th-sem-syllabus.netlify.app/)***

> P.S : Just upload the `public` folder on Netlify (drag-drop)
> I thought I had to drag and drop the entire project dir. But no, it was just the public dir.
> After compiling your hugo project all the necessary html and xml files are created inside the `project` dir
